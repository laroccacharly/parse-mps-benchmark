You have access to highspy solver to give you a baseline to compare your results. 
Give a time limit of 3 seconds for you algorithms to not waste time and iterate quickly. 
Use prints to help you debug and iterate. 
You must parse the MPS file to convert it to a format that can be used by your simplex solver. 
Check you objective value to what highspy returns. 
add prints to see you runtime at different points in your algorithm

always you uv. 
if you need dependencies, add them with uv add mypackage. You can use pandas, polars, numpy, scipy, etc. 
Run the code with uv run main.py
